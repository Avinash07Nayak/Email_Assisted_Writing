In this case study, we tried to build a NLP model which can predict words and characters as done in the mailing system mentioned above using a sequence to sequence model with attention mechanism.

We will use Enron Email dataset which is publicly available. Enron Corporation was an American energy, commodities, and services company based in Houston, Texas. The company went through an accounting scandal in 2001 and in October 2001, the company declared bankruptcy and its accounting firm, then one of the five largest audit and accountancy partnerships in the world was effectively dissolved. The Enron email dataset contains approximately 500,000 emails generated by employees of the Enron Corporation. It was obtained by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission during its investigation of Enron’s collapse.

Problem Statement: Create a model that can predict characters and words that the user is anticipated to type based on present text in the editor.

Type of Deep Learning Problem: This is a sequence to sequence deep learning problem where input to the model is the initial part of a sentence and the predicted output is the final part of the sentence.

Performance Metric: Perplexity with base e

Steps Performed:
· Exploratory Data Analysis
· Data Cleaning
· Data Pre-Processing
· Pre-Modelling
· Modelling

Result: After 59 epochs of training the model, both Training loss and Validation loss have stagnated and Validation loss is only slightly more than Training loss. The training loss at the end of 59 epochs in 1.2757 and validation loss is 1.2941.
